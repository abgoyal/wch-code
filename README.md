# WCH demo code
8051 code published by WCH

The code is public domain if not stated overwise. The original source code was published by WCH on wch.cn, winchiphead.com and wch-ic.com.

I didn't modify any information of the original source, only converted it from GB2312 to UTF-8 with UNIX line terminators.

Hope it may be usefull to someone.
